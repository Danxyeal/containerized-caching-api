# Containerized Secure Caching API (Pod)
Microservice Kube Pod that securely holds the API keys for a relevant service. It performs 2 main functions, it requests data from your secure APIs passing on the response to the calling client SPA, and it caches those responses.
Could be an idea for a SaaS startup - providing the service to busy developers who want to keep their frontend development simple while securing their API keys and and delicate endpoints.
